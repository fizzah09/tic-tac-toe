# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python's Tkinter library for the GUI.

## Features

- Two-player game: Play against a friend.
- Randomized player selection: The starting player is chosen randomly for each new game.
- Restart option: Restart the game at any time.
- Visual feedback: Winning rows are highlighted in green, and the current player's turn is displayed at the top.

## How to Play

1. Run the script `tic_tac_toe.py`.
2. Click on any empty cell in the grid to place your mark (X or O).
3. The game automatically alternates between players.
4. The game ends when a player wins, or all cells are filled without a winner (tie).
5. Click "Restart" to start a new game.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter library (usually included in Python installations)

## Running the Game

```bash
python tic_tac_toe.py
```
